I am a passionate Computer Science student currently pursuing my junior year at Carnegie Mellon University. My academic journey has been focused on exploring innovative solutions in the realm of robotics and artificial intelligence. 

Currently, I am working with Professor [Jiaoyang Li](https://jiaoyangli.me/) on problems related to multi-agent path finding. Prior to this, I worked on a multi-drone project under the guidance of [Prof. Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian/) and [Prof. Micah Corah](https://www.micahcorah.com/) at CMU Air Lab.
